As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With a silicon hump and your ten-inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was, Todd Browning streak he was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knees
I'm know you're not protected for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with killer pin

(Here they come) I keep a friend serene
(Here they come) Oh, baby, come unto me
(Here they come) Well, she's come, been, and gone

Come out of the doorway, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
That Halloween Jack is a real cool cat

And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meets his little hussey with his ghost town approach

Her face her saddest feature but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are civilised

Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs

Ooooooooh
In the year of the scavenger, season of the bitch

They sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch

Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sirens) Try and wake up tomorrow
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs

Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs

Woo-ooh-hoo-oo, call them the Diamond Dogs

Call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo call them the Diamond Dogs
Yeah ... oo-ooh-hoo-oo call them the Diamond Dogs
Woo-ooh-hoo-oo call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
Keep cool!
Diamond Dogs rule
OK?
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah. oh
Beware of the Diamond Dogs, yeah, oh
