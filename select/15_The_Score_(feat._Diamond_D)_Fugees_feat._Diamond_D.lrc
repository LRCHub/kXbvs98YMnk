[00:00.08] You rockin' live but you ain't sayin' nothing
[00:03.27] It's time to settle the score

[00:24.11] Rum to the ripple
[00:25.56] Sing boo
[00:26.35] But at times I come in triple
[00:40.85]

[00:52.22] 
[00:35.54] You in the wrong neighborhood, check the map.
[00:37.50] Hooo, you've got to go for backup
[00:39.50] To do what you gotta do.
[00:41.01] So you'll be back with France CU
[00:42.42] Traitor in your crew is mafo heat
[00:58.92] 
[00:43.93] You put the poison in my tea
[00:45.89] And kill the toad, But I'll be back with the centipede
[00:47.68] I'm on some new technique, drunken bamboo
[00:49.97] Awoo hoo a hoo, I'm taking all crews what
[00:52.75] Competition, stimulation for the rap man
[01:12.75] 
[00:54.70] Losers check your tooters
[00:56.13] While I'm suckin' on your girls hooters.
[00:57.74] Don't play macho, while you got the gun
[00:59.46] Cause if you got to reload
[01:12.46] 
[01:22.09] Wyclef the multi-talented
[01:23.68] Average heads can't handle it
[01:24.20] I'll bring it to you live
[01:25.79] Only if you want it
[01:35.29] 
[01:27.16] Me and my guitar go back like the days of the RMC's
[01:30.94] (C'mon check out my melody)
[01:32.09] The W-Y-C-L-E-F, Wyclef
[01:35.49] Through any contest
[01:36.43] I'm victorious
[01:37.30] Still keep it real, if you will and manifest
[01:39.36] Through your skills, not by how many shells you peel.
[02:05.86] 
[01:41.99] I'm a bring down the ruckus
[01:43.17] Play the nutcracker
[01:44.29] Rough-neck rednecks make me no bother
[01:46.74] Time after time, ask Cyndi Lauper
[01:49.20] Boss, you don't want to fuck with my partners
[02:11.70] 
[01:51.61] Motion, commotion, what's your proposal
[01:54.29] Uphold two-fold, the crew is disposal
[01:56.71] Like utensil, false idental,
[01:59.32] I autograph my lyrics with a number 2 pencil
[02:21.32] 
[02:21.30] I'm the L, Won't you pull it
[02:22.93] Straight to the head
[02:23.85] With the speed of a bullet
[02:25.60] Cuttin' niggas off at the meeky-freeky gullet
[02:27.52] Lyrical sedative, keep niggas medative
[02:46.52] 
[02:29.32] Head rushers I give to creative kids and fiends
[02:31.75] Dreams of euphoria
[02:32.82] Aurora
[02:33.36] To another galaxy
[02:34.00] Phallic-sy
[02:39.00] 
[02:35.19] Be this microphone, but get lifted
[02:36.96] Lyrically I'm gifted
[02:38.18] Burn on in without the roach clip (it)
[02:39.99] Henders, mind-bender
[02:41.35] Pleasure sender
[02:48.85] 
[02:41.74] So frequently your nerve endings belong to me
[02:43.54] Wrongfully you put me down not receiving the full capacity of my smoke
[02:47.44] Wack niggas choke
[02:49.94] From the fumes that I emote,
[02:51.18] Or emit shit
[02:57.18] 
[02:52.14] See even I feel the mahogany L
[02:53.71] Natural hallucinogen
[02:55.17] Turning boys to men again
[02:56.22] With estrogen dreams
[02:57.32] Release blues, yellows and greens
[02:58.14] From Brownsville to Queens
[03:11.14] 
[02:59.36] You rockin' live but you ain't saying nothing
[03:01.47] It's time to settle the score
[03:02.59] Ready or not. Refugees taking over
[03:06.08] 'Cause we soft spoken
[03:07.22] Doesn't mean that we've forgotten
[03:08.23] Now we permanently one
[03:09.78] And one day you will be forgotten
[03:26.28]

[03:33.16] I'm more magnificent than Lee Van Cliff
[03:35.57] You stand stiff and got the nerve to let your man riff
[03:38.16] (We know where to run)
[03:39.02] And start flakin' like dandruff
[03:54.52] 
[03:40.61] C'mon son my steelo's tight
